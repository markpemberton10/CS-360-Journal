Mobile App Code Design Artifact – Project Three
App Summary: Requirements and Goals

The mobile application I developed is a weight tracking and health management app designed to help users monitor their progress over time. The primary goal of the app is to provide users with a simple, organized way to record weight entries, view progress, and stay motivated toward achieving their health goals.

This app was designed to address user needs such as:

Tracking weight consistently over time

Viewing progress in a structured and easy-to-read format

Managing personal account information securely

Encouraging accountability through regular logging

The app focuses on simplicity, clarity, and functionality to ensure users can quickly record and review their data without confusion.

Screens and Features Supporting User Needs

To support user needs and create a user-centered UI, the app includes:

Login and Registration Screen – Allows users to securely create and access their accounts.

Main Dashboard Screen – Displays weight entries and allows users to add new data.

Data Entry Functionality – Enables users to input weight and track progress.

Database Integration – Stores user credentials and weight data securely.

The UI design followed user-centered principles by:

Keeping layouts simple and uncluttered

Using clear labels and buttons

Ensuring intuitive navigation between screens

Maintaining consistent design elements across activities

The design was successful because it prioritized ease of use. Users can quickly understand how to log in, add data, and view their information without unnecessary steps or complexity.

Coding Approach and Development Strategies

I approached coding the app in a structured and modular way. I first ensured the UI layouts were properly designed before connecting functionality. I then implemented features step-by-step:

Created the database helper class.

Developed user authentication functionality.

Connected UI components using findViewById.

Implemented navigation between activities.

Tested data storage and retrieval.

I used incremental testing and debugging throughout development to catch errors early. When encountering Gradle or dependency issues, I carefully analyzed error logs and resolved version conflicts systematically.

These strategies—incremental development, modular design, and systematic debugging—can be applied to future projects to reduce errors and improve efficiency.

Testing and Debugging Process

To ensure the app functioned properly, I:

Tested login and registration flows.

Verified database storage and retrieval.

Ran the app on an emulator.

Built and generated APK files to confirm successful compilation.

Debugged Gradle and dependency conflicts.

Testing is important because it ensures reliability, improves user experience, and prevents deployment failures. Through testing, I identified and resolved issues such as duplicate dependencies and incorrect resource references. This process strengthened my problem-solving skills and understanding of the Android build system.

Innovation and Problem Solving

During development, I encountered challenges such as dependency conflicts, Gradle configuration issues, and resource linking errors. To overcome these challenges, I researched error messages, modified build configurations, and adjusted dependencies to ensure compatibility.

One innovative aspect of my approach was resolving duplicate Kotlin dependency conflicts while maintaining a Java-based project structure. This required understanding how Gradle manages transitive dependencies and how to enforce consistent versions.

Demonstration of Knowledge and Skills

I was particularly successful in demonstrating my knowledge of:

Activity lifecycle management

Database integration using SQLite

User authentication logic

Gradle build configuration

Debugging and resolving dependency conflicts

Applying user-centered UI design principles

This project reflects my ability to design, develop, test, and prepare a functional Android application for deployment.
